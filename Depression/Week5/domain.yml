      Let's take an example of Ramya and Abdul.
   
      Ramya and Abdul are very similar in terms of their academic strengths and weaknesses. Both of them apply for a reputed internship program and get accepted!

  utter_week5_s40:

      This happened because Ramya fundamentally believed that she did not deserve the chance. Her core belief - "I'm not good enough" - made her see even a positive situation in a negative light.

      Great job, {name}! You found a good alternative core belief to train your mind with.
   
      There is another method we can use to combat core beliefs. You might have come across something similar in the past modules.

      In the second method, we try to find evidences for and against your core belief, and then change them into more accurate statements.

      Core beliefs are generally of 3 types:
      
      1. About yourself - "I'm worthless" 
      
      2. About others - "Everyone wants to see me fail."

  utter_week5_s72:
  - text: |- 
      I understand, {name}.

      So you see, your childhood experiences can contribute towards your core beliefs.
      
      Here are some more questions you can ask:
      
      1. Does your negative self image remind you of criticisms you have received from others when you were young?
      
  utter_week5_s73:
