      That's ok, {name}

      Let's try to learn more about what this means
   
      Control is basically exerting influence or power over the environment, actions, and behaviors of yourself or another person.

      There can be many reasons why you many feel like you need to be in control.

      Can you think of any?

  utter_week6_s44_a:
  - text: |- 
      Good job, {name}

      Here are a few common reasons that you might relate with:

      - fear of unpredictability

      - fear that things may fall apart if you don't control them

      - perfectionism

      - fear of delegating

      Overestimating your control over situations can cause anxiety or stress when things don't go your way.
