      Ok, {name}. Let's begin!

      title: Go to Step 1

  utter_week4_s89_a:
  - text: |- 
      Can you write down a thought that you frequently get, that you have identified as Labelling?

  utter_week4_s89_b:
  - text: |- 
      That sounds like a tough situation, {name}.
    buttons:
    - payload: /affirm
      title: Go to Step 2

  utter_week4_s90:
  - text: Ok. Can you now identify the label in this thought? For example, if your thought is "I'm such a loser.", the label would be the word loser.

  utter_week4_s91:
  - text: |- 
      Good, {name}. Now, let's try to find the definition of your label. Think to yourself what you mean by these labels. 
    buttons:
    - payload: /affirm
      title: Continue

  utter_week4_s91_a:
  - text: |- 
      You will discover there's no such thing as "a fool" or "a loser."

  utter_week4_s92:
  - text: Foolish behavior exists, but "fools" and "losers" do not.
    buttons:
    - payload: /affirm
      title: Yes, I see what you mean
    - payload: /affirm
      title: I think I understand...     

  utter_week4_s93:
  - text: |- 
      Good {name}.

  utter_week4_s94:
  - text: What we can do instead of labelling, is to be specific about the strengths and weaknesses.
    buttons:
    - payload: /affirm
      title: Can you give me an example?

  utter_week4_s95:
  - text: |- 
      Sure! So instead of thinking of yourself as defective or worthless, you can focus on your specific weaknesses, for example, time management, and find ways to tackle them.

  utter_week4_s96:
  - text: |- 
      Make sure you stick to reality while doing this.
    buttons:
    - payload: /affirm

      Can you write down a thought that you frequently get, that you have identified as a Should Statement?

  utter_week4_s98_b:
  - text: |- 
      Good job identifying the thought, {name}
    buttons:
    - payload: /affirm
      title: Go to Step 2

  utter_week4_s99:
  - text: Ok. Can you now identify the "Should" part of this thought? For example, if your thought is "I must have been more prepared", the "Should" part would be the word must.

  utter_week4_s100:
  - text: |- 
      Good, {name}.
    buttons:
    - payload: /affirm
      title: Go to Step 3

  utter_week4_s100_a:
  - text: |- 
      Now, let's try to replace this word with a better, less emotional word. 

      For example, instead of thinking "I must have been more prepared.", you could think "It would have been better if I would have been more prepared."
 
  utter_week4_s101:

      Good effort, {name}!

  utter_week4_s102:

      Ok, {name}.  

      Can you write down a thought that you frequently get, that you have identified as Emotional Reasoning?

  utter_week4_s103:
  - text: |- 
      Ok. No let's try to separate the thought and feeling in this statement.

      For example, if your thought is "I'm lonely because I'm unlovable.", you can separate it into:

      Thought - I think I'm unlovable Feeling - I'm feeling lonely

    buttons:

    - payload: /affirm
      title: I guess so...  

  utter_week4_s109:
  - text: Great! Do you now understand that just because you might be experiencing an emotion (loneliness, shame, guilt, etc.), it doesn't make your negative thought (thinking that you're unloved, that you made a big mistake, etc.) completely true?
    buttons:
